# Snyk Gameday Package

This package has been created as part of a gameday exercise.

## What is a Gameday?

Gamedays are a tried and tested repeatable collaborative learning exercise that tests an organization and individuals skills and readiness to solve a real world problem or event in a simulated, risk-free environment. 

There are three main parties involved:

* Gameday team simulates an important event using fabricated information and data
* Participants react to the simulation in real time as if they were dealing with an actual event
* Observers observe participants and note their reactions to asses and learn from the event
